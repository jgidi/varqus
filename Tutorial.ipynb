    "The problem of simulating quantum many-body systems is well-known to be extremely challenging for classical computers. This is due to the exponential dimension of the associated Hilbert space. For these systems, it is impossible to diagonalize the Hamiltonian to find the ground state energy, or to solve the Schrödinger equation to obtain its time evolution. Variational Classical Simulation (VCE) $[$[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_method_(quantum_mechanics)), [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-4916(88)90280-1), [3](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.070601)$]$ is an alternative to these direct methods because effectively reduces the dimension of systems using efficient classical representations. It can be used to find the ground state energy and to simulate time evolution of quantum systems. However, for highly-entangled systems VQE is usually infeasible, because there are not good classical representations of these states. \n",

    "where $e^{-i H_j \\Delta t}$ is the unitary generated by $H_j$ for a short time $\\Delta t = T/N$. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) are the quantum version of VCE and they can be used to find the ground state energy of relevant Hamiltonians using efficient variational forms and classical optimization. These algorithms can also be used as an alternative for Trotterization, that usually requires circuits with many quantum operations and a large depth. This is not desirable in the current era of quantum computation, because quantum processors are still noisy and the depth of the circuits is restricted by the decoherence time of the system. For VQA, the depth of the circuit is fixed during all the computation and we can choose variational forms that are efficient for different hardwares.\n",
